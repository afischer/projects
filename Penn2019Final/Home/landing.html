		<div>An acceptance to Penn means an acceptance to opportunities that I never knew would exist when I received my own letter more than three years ago. It means a chance to step outside of your comfort zone, a chance to learn and grow in an environment rich in cultural diversity. It means an opportunity to learn about yourself, to discover and develop your own passions, and an opportunity to get to know others and their stories. Being at Penn for three years has taught me to not take anything for granted and to make every moment — every decision count.Now comes the time to make one of your most important decisions. Penn isn’t the right place for everyone, trust me. But we do hope it’s the place for you, and we’ve put this site together to help you decide.
And for those of you who have already chosen Penn, we hope this site will only build your excitement to come to the campus and city you will call home until 2019.
Here at The Daily Pennsylvanian we try to be your source of all things entertaining, informing and relevant. When you arrive on campus — and even before that — we want you to engage with our products, from 34th Street, our arts and culture magazine, and Under the Button, our 24/7 all-things-Penn blog, to the DP, our daily publication.
So use us to explore, to learn about what life at Penn is really like and get excited for what I hope is as great of a ride for you as it has been for me. We’re here to tell your stories and to engage you in your Penn experience in whatever way we can.
Enjoy thedp.com/ClassOf2019 and the rest of thedp.com, and we look forward to seeing you on campus in August, saying hi – and handing you a copy of the DP.
