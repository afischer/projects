                    <p class="section-main-text">Former Penn men’s basketball coach Jerome Allen has remained a key witness for the investigation into the college admissions bribery scandal that came to light in March 2019. He plead guilty in October 2018 to accepting bribes in exchange for recruitment of a player. In March, Allen testified in a federal trial that Philip Esformes paid him to facilitate his son’s recruitment in 2015. Although the national scandal that broke days after Allen's testimony did not name Penn, Dean of Admissions Eric Furda said Penn would consider revising its recruitment process. During Esformes' trial, news broke that he had also sent more than $400,000 to the consultant at the center of the national scandal after contacting him about his son’s recruitment. Esformes’ trial ended in April when he was found guilty on 20 charges, including bribery. In July, a judge sentenced Allen to four years probation, community service, and a fine, avoiding jail time. The next day, Penn Athletics removed Allen from its Hall of Fame.</p>

                    <p class="section-main-text">In February, the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first
                        time in history. On the night of the Eagles win, herds of Penn students paraded to Center City
                        to join the chaotic celebration, which saw people climbing lamp posts and flipping cars.
                        Philadelphia later scheduled a parade to honor the Eagles' homecoming, prompting local schools
                        and colleges to close for the day. After a student petition that garnered over 3,000 signatures,
                        Penn joined the other schools in suspending operations for the day. With the day off, Penn
                        students flocked to the historic parade to catch a glimpse of the football team, joining 700,000
                        Eagles fans and Philadelphia natives.</p>

                    <p class="section-main-text">In February, the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first
                        time in history. On the night of the Eagles win, herds of Penn students paraded to Center City
                        to join the chaotic celebration, which saw people climbing lamp posts and flipping cars.
                        Philadelphia later scheduled a parade to honor the Eagles' homecoming, prompting local schools
                        and colleges to close for the day. After a student petition that garnered over 3,000 signatures,
                        Penn joined the other schools in suspending operations for the day. With the day off, Penn
                        students flocked to the historic parade to catch a glimpse of the football team, joining 700,000
                        Eagles fans and Philadelphia natives.</p>

                        <p class="section-main-text">Penn volleyball’s first season under the direction of coach Iain Braddak was a tumultuous one. Despite several players having reservations about Braddak during the hiring process, Penn Athletics gave him the job in 2018. In addition to being the worst season in program history, eight players filed formal grievances with Penn Athletics against their coach for his conduct during the year. The administration responded to the situation by setting up a team-wide mediation session called restorative justice, in which a third-party firm administered a three-hour meeting attended by all 20 players on the team, Braddak, and Associate Athletic Director Matt Valenti. Braddak returned for the 2019 season with the hope of focusing on the future of the program. However, a different type of setback occurred near the end of the season when Penn Athletics announced that the remaining two games of the team’s season would be canceled following the administration’s discovery of “vulgar, offensive, and disrespectful posters” in the team’s locker room. Multiple athletes on the team did not respond to requests for comment, while Penn Athletics stated that the cancellation had nothing to do with last season’s grievances.</p>

                        <p class="section-main-text">Penn volleyball’s first season under the direction of coach Iain Braddak was a tumultuous one. Despite several players having reservations about Braddak during the hiring process, Penn Athletics gave him the job in 2018. In addition to being the worst season in program history, eight players filed formal grievances with Penn Athletics against their coach for his conduct during the year. The administration responded to the situation by setting up a team-wide mediation session called restorative justice, in which a third-party firm administered a three-hour meeting attended by all 20 players on the team, Braddak, and Associate Athletic Director Matt Valenti. Braddak returned for the 2019 season with the hope of focusing on the future of the program. However, a different type of setback occurred near the end of the season when Penn Athletics announced that the remaining two games of the team’s season would be canceled following the administration’s discovery of “vulgar, offensive, and disrespectful posters” in the team’s locker room. Multiple athletes on the team did not respond to requests for comment, while Penn Athletics stated that the cancellation had nothing to do with last season’s grievances.</p>
