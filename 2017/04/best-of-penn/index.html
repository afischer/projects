                It&apos;s always a struggle for Penn students to get out of bed early, but not for those who wait in line for Lyn&apos;s. Located on Spruce Street in front of the Quad, Lyn&apos;s attracts foodies with its hearty, filling sandwiches. The truck operates from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, offering inexpensive breakfast and lunch options. Vegetarian or not, you can&apos;t go wrong with any of the egg sandwiches, with toasted wheat bread, gooey cheese and scrambled eggs mixed with veggies. Lyn&apos;s special Eggplant Spinach Parm never fails to satisfy, and a choice of pita bread is also available. For healthy food lovers, you can also order egg whites. Start your morning with a hot bacon, egg and cheese bagel. Or if you want a meaty sandwich before your next class, the sausage and meatball sandwiches hardly disappoints. And what&apos;s better than a fresh sandwich? A smiling woman like Lyn who moves like lightning and remembers your regular orders.

                Every school has its landmarks, and Penn's are almost all food related. But there’s always one food truck to rule them all—and it is by no doubt Magic Carpet, home of the banana chocolate chip cookies and falalfel rice bowls that students will stand in line for until the day they die. If you’re in line by 12:50, you're semi safe. You still have a day ahead of you. If you get slowed down on Locust for just 2 minutes and roll up at 12:52, you might as well set up camp. The line will probably start somewhere in the Quad. Is it worth it? That's the dumbest question you'll ever ask yourself after finishing the Trojan Bowl or getting knee deep in the spinach pie. This savory goodness is the one thing people won't get mad at you for eating in the huntsman QSR. Because they understand. Because we aren't animals, and we have respect for a food truck that can churn out Michelin star food from a 8x4 box on Spruce Street. Mag Carp will forever remain an anomaly in the food truck world, pleasing bougie Manhatten-raised Penn kids until the day its bright green awning turns the color of College Hall.

                Imagine a beautiful building on Penn&apos;s campus. Come on, just close your eyes and do it. I know you&apos;re thinking of the same place I am&mdash;the towering Gothic structure made of green serpentine stone that was the first building on Penn&apos;s new campus when
                it moved from Center City. College Hall is the literal and spiritual center of the University, the green heart at its center. You can snap gorgeous pictures of the flowering trees that bloom against the building, or get creative with your
                photographic framing and capture the homophobic protesters against a backdrop of its historic architecture.
              </p>
              <p>
                Inside, the bowels of the building only amplify the majesty of the facade. Walk up into the belly of the beast and you can find a treasure trove of old-ass things to bolster your digital aesthetic. Look out for the Office of Admissions, Amy G&apos;s secret
                lair, the magnificent cavern that is College Hall 200 and the collegiate secrecy of the Philomathean Society. All are aesthetically pleasing options for proving to your followers that Penn can look like an actual Ivy League school. Sometimes
                there are even fun Snapchat filters to really help you bolster your brand across multiple platforms. Thanks Fossil Free Penn or that sexy Sit-In border for all of our selfies. But really, there&apos;s no better building to photograph Penn through
                the seasons and make your friends on the West Coast jealous af.

            Back during freshman year, the only reason you would be jealous of your friends living in Hill (or as freshmen now know it, the sad pile of bricks in New College House's backyard) was that they were that much closer to the sweet, sweet taste of Sabrina&apos;s
            french toast. Philly can come up with as many gimmicky brunch restaurants as possible, and while we&apos;ll probably still try them all, you can&apos;t top a classic.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don&apos;t want to sound dramatic and say that the first time you take a bite of Sabrina&apos;s
            stuffed challah bread french toast is actually a religious experience&mdash;but I'm also not not saying that. And if you somehow get sick of the Sabrina&apos;s classic (is this a possibility even? Let us know.) the weirdly-specific themed menu for
            specials always keeps things fresh. Also can I take a second to appreciate the fact that you can CALL AHEAD at Sabrina&apos;s to avoid the line? Given the perfect inverse relationship between brunch satisfaction and wait time, that&apos;s a true game-changer.
            It&apos;s just another reason why Sabrina&apos;s is on a whole other level.

                Nestled in the heart of Chinatown, Dim Sum Garden is the gold standard for BYOs. From the lively camaraderie to the delicious Chinese soup dumplings, Dim Sum Garden is the perfect place to drink Franzia and bond with those club members whose names you
                still don&apos;t really know. The restaurant itself isn&apos;t too big, which is even more conducive to bonding, especially when you&apos;re four glasses in and ravenously biting into some bao zi or lao mian. From Thursday to Sunday, the place is pretty
                packed, so plan accordingly if you have a big group and want to be seated quickly. If you really want to avoid the crowds, try coming in during brunch time. The service is fast and the food is delicious and reasonably priced, making Dim
                Sum Garden a great place for a casual bonding sesh. There is, however, a credit card minimum&mdash;so make sure you have some cash if you play on splitting the bill.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you&apos;re feeling adventurous, try Shanghai pan fried pork dumplings for a twist on the traditional soup dumplings or the Scallion pancakes for a savory Eastern take on a traditional Western breakfast staple. Aside from their carby delights, their vegetable
                creations and chicken selections are also delicious. Try the pickled cabbage, bean curd skin and soybean for a slightly salty vegetarian friendly option or the poached chicken with chili sauce for a spicy surprise (definitely get a bowl
                of rice to temper the spices in this).
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to food, there&apos;s also a decent selection of bubble tea and smoothies available. But, if that doesn&apos;t satisfy your sweet tooth there&apos;s also a small selection of traditional Chinese desserts, such as Chinese rice pudding and sweet rice ball
                soup.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, if you&apos;d rather enjoy your dim sum in peace, they also deliver.

            Although weekend brunches may be the only time some of us get to enjoy the culinary delicacies the morning has to offer, there&apos;s a special place in our hearts for a more casual breakfast. Metropolitan Bakery and Cafe comes out on top for our choice breakfast
            on campus. Strong coffee with cheap refills with freshly made pastries and bagels make Metro hard to beat. Metro&apos;s selection leaves little to be desired, with classic sweets like lemon bars and even dog treats, there&apos;s bound to be something
            here for anyone to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            But let&apos;s face it: although Metro&apos;s baked goods and bagels may be a cut above the rest, there&apos;s more to the best breakfast than that. It&apos;s about atmosphere. Breakfast is a time for gathering yourself for the morning ahead, and Metro&apos;s laid back vibes
            and lack of wifi make it the perfect place to have a calm start to your morning. Rather than the hustle and bustle, grab and go vibe that too many coffee shops and bakeries embrace, Metro takes a classic approach to the morning. A cup of coffee,
            small talk and something sweet&mdash;a formula that&apos;s hard to master, but Metro delivers.

                high-quality coffee, the company has made some pretty creative strides in crafting coffee drinks. The Philadelphia-based company is probably most famous for their draft latte on tap: frothy, creamy cold lattes which come out of a beer-style
                tap. La Colombe has also come up with their own tap version of cold brew, called Pure Black and Pure Black and Tan, which is half Pure Black and half a draft latte. You can now get canned Pure Black and draft lattes at Houston, including
                vanilla and mocha-flavored draft lattes.

            Let's face it, you've had a long day. Your Soul Cycle class was at 8 a.m. this morning because you had to make it back in time for your 10:30 class in Annenberg, Magic Carpet ran out of veggie burgers and banana-chocolate chip cookies by 1 p.m., and you
            don&apos;t even want to think about how you have absolutely nothing to wear for your mixer tonight. Luckily, the luxurious Radian is there to welcome you and your long day with a well-earned nap. Home to some of Street&apos;s best Overheards, the Radian
            has everything: apartments, floors, doors and all of the other stuff that makes it worth the rent every month. Only a 30-second walk from Sweetgreen, 3925 Walnut Street is the place to be at all times of the day, especially with its 24/7-ish

            As you move into your room in the Quad, you may grimace at the minuscule space between the desk and the bed and the squeak of the rickety furniture. As you move out, you&apos;ll tear up over the small sink you took your makeup off at 4 am and the lounge you
            piled into during NSO.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how many new dorms are built on Penn&apos;s campus, the Quad remains the best place to live. It has all the essentials: air conditioning, personal sinks, a dining hall, libraries and a gym. It&apos;s the simplicity of the Quad that gives freshmen what
            they need most: community.
          </p>
          <p>
            From your first day to the last, there is something comforting walking into the Quad and knowing you&apos;re entering a space where (almost) everyone is a freshman like you. The University suddenly feels small and united. At one end, students play catch on
            the grass; on the other they run back and forth between laundry. Residential programs and study breaks thrive with abundant baked goods (two words: Cookie Night). The laughter and shouts of fellow freshmen stumbling back home after a night
            out will seep through thin windows as both a menace and lullaby.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the end of the day and through the end of senior year, Penn life still revolves around those three initials, UQG (Upper Quad Date). It&apos;s where the Ubers are hailed, the Fling crowd enters, the Hey Day revelers march. Moving into some spacious high
            rise or off-campus apartment, you will laugh at how you crowded into the Quad, but know you wouldn&apos;t have done freshman year any other way.

            pitchers of Yuengling to the notorious Blue Drink. And Smokes&apos; plays all the essential jams: Mr. Brightside, Sweet Caroline, Mambo No. 5 and of course, Party in the U.S.A. Smokes&apos; is where you run into the baseball team, the entire class of
            2017 and the girl you talked to once on your freshman hall and never again. As Carly Rae Jepsen sang, whoa-uh-oh [Smokes&apos;] is always a good time.

                Under or over 21, you can find the happiest of happy hours at Distrito. Located on the corner of 40th and Chestnut streets, this self-described &#147;modern Mexican small plates&#148; restaurant offers a great happy hour special from 5pm to 7pm every day of the
                week.
              </p>
              <p>
                For just $5, you can enjoy a substantial serving of chips and salsa - enough to share with a friend or two! Of, for $7, you can indulge in veggie nachos with queso mixto, rajas, black beans, chile de arbol and crema. Note that on the regular taqueria
                menu the larger &#147;super nachos&#148; cost $12 and are typically too much for one or two people. The happy hour option is ideal for a smaller group!

                Now, for those who are 21, Distrito&apos;s happy hour is even more enticing. Margaritas and sangria, which typically sell for $9 a glass, cost just $5 and $6, respectively. And the margs are strong&mdash;the perfect concoction to get your night going. Select beers
                also go for $5 a bottle.

                Do you want your ice cream served in a Chinese food takeout box at a classy, soda-fountain-style setup? Of course you do. Well, look no further than a true establishment in Philly’s frozen treats scene: Franklin Fountain. Located in the heart of Old City—less than a minute’s walk from the 2nd Street stop off the Market Frankford Line, you have no excuse to not go. Since 2004, Franklin Fountain has been serving up everything from classic flavors like Philadelphia-style vanilla ice cream and hydrox cookie, the OG cookies and cream, to some more unique flavors, like green tea and teaberry gum.
              </p>
              <p>
                To walk into an often understandably busy Franklin Fountain is to step into a moment of pure American nostalgia. It’s the kind of place that you’d imagine your grandparents going on a date and that Lana Del Rey would probably wistfully croon about. With employees dressed as old-timey ice cream parlor workers—bowties, hats, white coats and aprons—and impeccably curated décor with beautifully tiled floors and plenty of dark wood, Franklin Fountain is as much an aesthetic experience as it is a good time for your taste buds. Along with a variety of delicious standard flavors, Franklin Fountain also serves seasonal sorbets and featured flavors that shift in and out, as well as sugar free and non-dairy varieties for those with dietary restrictions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Who to take to Franklin Fountain? Literally anyone and everyone who will go with you. Parents? Yes. Friends. Of course. Yourself after you finish that research paper? Treat. Yo. Self. Dates, Tinder or otherwise? It’ll probably end adorably given the setting, so yes (also it’s right next to Penn’s Landing, so grab some ice cream and sit romantically by the water). When you go, and you really should, consider trying black raspberry, peanut butter, rocky road, or Franklin mint chip, or maybe just everything, no judgement. Happy eating!
              </p>
              <p>
                A visit to the Penn Book Center is never anything less than pleasant. Besides rushing in between classes to grab a required reading (or ten) you can also spend a few quiet moments perusing the aisles. The selection is relatively small&mdash;this isn&apos;t a Barnes
                &amp; Noble we&apos;re talking about&mdash;but it&apos;s eclectic. If you spend enough time looking, you&apos;ll probably find a new favorite book to add to your collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of everything else, the bookstore offers a rewards program for students. Can&apos;t go wrong with that.

                At Penn, I take our pizza seriously. I swear by our slices as a late night order, a hangover cure, a dinner to take to Huntsman and a drunchie to soak up the booze. And I tend to scour the city for the best pizza joint&mdash;the bigger-than-your-head slices
                downtown, the eclectic West Philly pizza confections. But one spot stands far above the rest&mdash; good ol&apos; Smokey Joe&apos;s.

              <p>
                There&apos;s still an alarmingly large number of students on campus who don&apos;t know that beloved Smokes' is home to Enjay&apos;s Pizza, the best pizza in West Philadelphia and just as good (if not better) than anything you can find in Center City. Enjay&apos;s serves
                good starters like garlic knots and wings, plus trusted sandwiches and burgers, but the pizza is by far the main attraction. Smokes&apos; pizza strikes the perfect balance between that upscale feel and adored grimy vibe&mdash;the pizzas are wood-fired
                and crisp, but still served in a dimly-lit bar. The pies feel fit for a foodie without sacrificing the classic bread, cheese and tiny bit of grease that we love so much. The menu boasts a handful of tasty choices, or you can opt to build
                your own. Enjay&apos;s certainly doesn&apos;t slack on toppings&mdash;you can go classic with cheese and pepperoni, or go fancy with caramelized onions or cremini mushrooms. At the end of the day, there&apos;s something for pizza lovers of all kinds at Smokes',
                making it hands down the best pizza on campus. I'm willing to fight you on it.

                It&apos;s been a year, and Street still hasn&apos;t changed its mind about Parc. If there is one place that can take away the pain of an uncomfortable family interaction, it&apos;s Parc. There is a reason this place is quite possibly the SABSiest eatery off campus&mdash;
                the Frontera of the East, if you will. The only thing more addicting than the food is the ambiance. This bougie brasserie makes Rittenhouse Square feel like the streets of Paris. It is the quintessential crowd pleaser for any meal: breakfast,
                brunch, lunch, linner? (Sorry, I'm inventing more meals in the day so I can come here more often), dinner, and dessert. It&apos;s a good thing calories don&apos;t count when the food is free (or, at least, on your parents&apos; card), because this is
                the place to indulge yourself. If the macaroni au gratin doesn&apos;t cure your midterm blues, the profiteroles most certainly will. If your parents are still preaching that &#147;eat your vegetables&#148; nonsense, start with the warm shrimp salad.
                It will make both your parents and your stomach happy. One meal here, and Ramen won&apos;t satisfy you in the same way again.

                This is an obvious pick. Not only is Wawa paramount to Pennsylvania and the general tri-state area, it&apos;s also a staple of dear old Penn.You&apos;ve been coming to Wawa since your first day of NSO freshman year, when it was the only food source you were competent
                enough to walk to without using Google maps. At the end of a hot August day of classes, their milkshake machine will always have your back. At midnight on a Tuesday, when you&apos;re walking back from a pre-midterm cram session, their candy
                section is your refuge. Their coffee will never overcharge you, and their doors will never shut on you. Plus, any hoagie inevitably tastes better when you&apos;ve ordered it from a touch screen. They have ATMs for a last minute cash withdrawal,
                and pints of ice cream in which you can bury any heartbreak. Their water is technically free, as is the warm ambiance of their perpetually well-stocked products and the kind exchanges you can get from their star cashiers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though Penn is often called out for its Goose-loving culture, there is an even better goose in town that really deserves all our love and attention: the Wawa logo. Wawa is our past, our present, and our future (see: aforementioned sandwich touch screen
                technology). So, to our true day one homie, thank you.

                As you step foot into Dana Mandi, the smoky aroma of spices hits you like a wave. You&apos;re instantaneously transported from 42nd and Chestnut, to a snack-filled haven and specialty grocery store.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tucked away behind the grocery store is the kitchen. In all honesty, figuring out how to order will take you as long as it did to find out where your Williams recitation room was, so I'll help you out. As you weave your way through the aisles, you&apos;ll
                reach the restaurant portion, set up with tables and an open window through which the kitchen is visible. You take an index card, write down what you would like, and then hand it to the person waiting to collect your order. Highlights
                include, the cauliflower stuffed paratha, chicken biriyani and palak paneer. As you wait for the food to be prepared and brought up to the main cash register, feel free to peruse the rest of the store. The crunchy chickpeas are mind-blowing,
                and the frozen food selection is extensive. Maybe treat yourself to a warm samosa at the checkout counter.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dana Mandi is authentic, and delicious. If you decide to dine in house you can even walk off your meal while stocking up on all the essentials. The ambiance may not be A+, but the everyone will be super understanding when your backpack knocks over a whole
                shelf of mango juice! You win some, you lose some.

                Whether it&apos;s Wednesday at 8 p.m. or Saturday at 2 a.m., we know that Fresh Grocer is there&mdash;at the corner of campus&mdash;to satisfy our cravings for virtually everything. The all-encompassing grocery store has filled our cupboard, powered our kitchens and supplied much of our food, drinks and everything else we need. When we&apos;re not eating at Sweetgreen or Honeygrow or any other restaurant, we&apos;re likely chowing down on something&mdash;snacks, fruits, desserts&mdash;that we got from our constant runs to FroGro.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, we&apos;re still trying to grow accustomed to the one-of-a-kind layout of the store: the aisles set at weird angles, the items located in unusual places as if someone just went around putting random foods and drinks on the shelves.
              </p>
              <p>
                But ultimately, even after unintentionally strolling down the same aisle again or panicking that we might not find a way out, we walk out of FroGro with bags stuffed with the things that will keep us alive and awake. While the grocery store may not be as beloved by Penn&apos;s Facilities and Real Estate Services, if it eventually leaves, we&apos;ll miss running to get food at 3 a.m. or trying to navigate our way around those oddly-angled aisles.

            From Monday to Thursday, we eat the chipotle chicken sandwich from Frontera for lunch. No exceptions. I have back-to-back classes from 10:30 to 1:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays, so I need to grab something on the run between the two or I&apos;ll end up eating
            one of my classmates in Language &amp; Thought class. Thanks to Tapingo (by the way, can we agree to pronounce this app &#147;tuh-PING-o&#148; and not &#147;tap-in-go&#148;? It sounds way cooler that way), I can order my sandwich in Spanish class and pick it up
            on the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let&apos;s talk about why Frontera is awesome. First of all, it provides you the option to SABS&mdash;but also gives you the opportunity to chill on a comfy couch inside if you don&apos;t want to see and/or be seen. Secondly, it&apos;s convenient to access many of Penn&apos;s
            student cultural centers in the basement. Finally, the food is good as fuck&mdash;and that&apos;s probably because legendary chef Rick Bayless is the man behind the curtain (Ed. note: did you know Rick&apos;s brother is the famously annoying Skip Bayless
            from ESPN&apos;s &#147;First Take?&#148; Any sports fans reading this? Hello? Is this thing on?).
          </p>
          <p>
            Frontera also has less annoying hours than Houston, more variety than Joe&apos;s Caf&eacute; and you don&apos;t have to sell your soul and enter Huntsman like you do with Bridge Caf&eacute;. Chips and guac are an easy go-to if you don&apos;t want a full meal. The horchata
            drink thing is fire too. Honestly, the entire menu is fire. One time they fucked up and gave me the wrong sandwich and I didn&apos;t even mind because the wrong sandwich was pretty damn good too. Never change, Frontera. I&apos;ll remember you more than
            most of my acquaintances here.

                Nestled on the corner of 36th and Walnut streets, the Penn Bookstore is the go to place for all your course books, the latest Quaker apparel and those infamous &#147;Penn Mom&#148; mugs. While some might associate the bookstore with prospective student tours and obligatory parent&apos;s weekend visits, the store actually offers variety of resources for the typical Penn student.
              </p>
              <p>
                For many freshman the Penn Bookstore acts as a key start to their Penn experience, whether it is buying a computer or trying on a Penn hat. The Bookstore is also the destination for anything and everything involving Penn Cards, whether students are looking for a replacement or wanting to link it with a bank account. It also is one of the best places to easily order and pick up course textbooks at the start of each semester.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some professors will even require students to purchase a &#147;bundle&#148; of textbooks that can only be found at the Penn Bookstore. Besides offering these student essentials, the store also houses a cafe that serves Starbucks&apos; coffee and is a quiet, quaint place for a perfect study spot.

                Warm, cozy and quiet&mdash;all qualities that make up a perfect bookstore. The Penn Book Center is all of those things. The store is an inviting sort of space, and it smells like a bookstore should: like old pages in old books.
              </p>
              <p>
                You&apos;ve probably made your way to the little shop on the corner of 34th and Sansom at some point to buy books for an English class. You were greeted with a nod, or maybe a hello. You found your professor&apos;s name on the big white board in the center of the store, and got
                your books from the corresponding section on one of the shelves near the back wall. You likely left with an armful of books.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Book Center is never too crowded or overwhelming, and the whole process usually takes about five minutes. The store&apos;s system makes finding what you need easy and stress-free, but if you still need assistance the staff will be more than happy to help.
                The people who work at the Penn Book Center are plenty friendly. They aren&apos;t at all pushy or too in-your-face, but they&apos;re friendly and receptive to conversation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A visit to the Penn Book Center is never anything less than pleasant. Besides rushing in between classes to grab a required reading (or ten) you can also spend a few quiet moments perusing the aisles. The selection is relatively small&mdash;this isn&apos;t a Barnes
                &amp; Noble we&apos;re talking about&mdash;but it&apos;s eclectic. If you spend enough time looking, you&apos;ll probably find a new favorite book to add to your collection.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of everything else, the bookstore offers a rewards program for students. Can&apos;t go wrong with that.
