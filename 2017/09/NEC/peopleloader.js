        "stmt": "I'm running for Executive VP of Class Board because every day I wake up in my tiny dorm room in Riepe, look around Penn and Think “damn, I’d TAP that”. By that I mean, I want to Thrive At Penn but most importantly, I want to see others Thrive. I think the best way to do that is by making people happy, closer together and closer to the fundamental traditions that underlie Penn. My platform is simple but intricate: it consists of three big ideas that are all interconnected. Inclusion, Expansion, Collaboration. By Inclusion I mean catering to the hundreds of ethnicities and nationalities at Penn as many students feel left out at times during Penn traditions and events. How will we do that? Expansion: adding events to NSO and expanding on current Penn traditions to make them Bigger and Better. Another Part of Inclusion is Socio-Economic Inclusion: Find ways to pay for many events such as fling tanks and Harry Potter Shirts. How? Collaboration with different groups and organizations on campus such as the UA and Student Financial Services. I have also many other ideas (like study breaks with Dogs/Cats) which you will hear about throughout the Campaign!"

Casey, John I had no idea what NSO was going to be like, and Hollywood definitely distorted my view of college. I thought everyone drank; I thought everyone partied. I wanted to fit the mold. The first day of NSO, I met with friends in a dorm room and took shots of Vodka. We were stupid; we left the window blinds open. Within minutes, there was a knock at the door. It was an RA. I frantically searched for a hiding spot. I even considered lunging for the closet. I decided against it; we let the RA in, and I mentally packed my dorm… my roommate was going to love his new single. “I’m not superstitious, but I’m a little stitious” --Michael Scott.

It only took a few days on campus to instill a passion about Penn and it’s unmatched student life and culture. Penn is the perfect crossroads between academia and community, ambition and joy, intelligence and humility. Nonetheless, I believe anything can be improved. If elected to the undergraduate assembly, I will use my passion for Penn to work with the rest of the assembly, and the greater student body, to make this university the best it can be. Coming from a rural background, I have a different perspective of this urban campus;  A different view of any situation is beneficial.  Similarly to every other candidate for Undergraduate Assembly, I have the necessary leadership skills and experiences.

I would work towards cultivating more classes and programs where students are able to weave different disciplines together while further engaging with their peers in the classroom. Analyzing principles of physics through dance or studying community psychology through sports history allows students to explore their interests in unconventional ways and provides them with opportunities to engage with more students outside their discipline. Not only do I wish to make learning more collaborative but also impactful. By working to create more Academically Based Community Service classes that cover a range of student interests from engineering to theater, all Penn students should have the opportunity to engage with their community in a way that intrigues them.

Through inclusivity, my platform aims to ensure that students at Penn can be comfortable regardless of their personal background. There’s a disproportionate amount of people who utilize and are aware of campus resources. This is where student curated content, resource guides, and subsidized resources can serve marginalized communities like FGLI students.

As an immigrant who moved to the U.S. in middle school, everything I have achieved would’ve never happened without the friends and family who supported me through every step. I know I am fortunate and I am thankful, and student government has been my most direct outlet to express that gratitude. If I am elected, I plan on adding more water fountains and trash cans to the quad, fixing the AC problem in English, emphasizing quality over quantity for food in most dining halls, adding Joe Biden Sighting Alert on PennMobile, and most importantly, hearing you guys out as much as possible. I am here to serve because my happiness stems from the satisfactions of others, so vote Kevin Zhou for UA, and I promise to work my magic ;)"
