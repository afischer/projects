  			  <p>
            In our three-and-a-half years working at The Daily Pennsylvanian, close to 10 students have died by suicide, a statistic as remarkable to write as it is now commonplace to hear across campus. With each email from some Penn administrator, we have grown to numb ourselves to feeling pain, to mourning the death of someone close to us, to finally attaching a name to the problem of mental illness endemic to so many at Penn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mental health is an intensely personal topic, shaped inexorably by the circumstances, preferences and lifestyle of an individual person. Starting a dialogue on mental health requires patience to grasp at what is elusive and acceptance of the impossibility of capturing every nuance of stress, addiction and trauma. A conversation about mental health can take a variety of forms. What it cannot tolerate is silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the DP and 34th Street today and online, an extraordinarily dedicated team of writers, editors, designers and photographers have singularly committed themselves to breaking that silence. For months, the DP and Street have been coordinating a day completely devoted to coverage of mental health encompassing angles as varied as student narratives, tips for self-care and investigations of University policy. If you're looking for an update on how Penn football performed at Brown this weekend, or a look at how many crimes were reported during Halloweekend, theDP.com will continue to be updated with fresh content by the minute.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the moment we stepped on campus, we have come to believe that mental health is the issue of our time at Penn. Whether that coverage takes the form of explanatory pieces noting the brilliant resources available to assist students or exploring ways the University can do more to help students, we are committed to keeping a dialogue open on health, self-care and wellness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Devoting full issues of the DP and Street to covering as many angles of this intensely complex issue is, for us, a no brainer.
          </p>
          <p>
            By no less than a happy accident, the publication of our special issue on mental health falls on the same day as a “Campus Conversation” organized by Penn administrators to discuss “what we can do, individually and collectively, to take care of ourselves and others and to foster individual and community resilience.” That conversation, set to take place from 5-7 p.m. in Zellerbach Theater, is one of the first instances we can recall of something that should come as instinctual to University leadership: a willing acknowledgement that its students are struggling.
          </p>
          <p>
            In announcing the event, Penn officials wrote, “A community that values wellness, community support, and resilience is best poised to find creative and constructive solutions to our challenges.” We could not agree more with the spirit of this statement and hope that in these pieces, interested readers can find a multitude of ways to begin confronting those difficult, necessary challenges.

                  Penn administrators have worked to improve policies
                  surrounding mental health, but gaps still exist. These
                  articles examine the policies that are in place, how they
                  serve students, how they don’t and whether they’re enough.

                Approximately 20 percent of students at Penn are prescribed medication from CAPS to manage their mental health. While these students say that their prescriptions are essential to managing their health at Penn, they recognize that there are often financial or logistical barriers that prevent others from gaining access to this resource.
