              UTB is Penn’s most-read blog and your only 24/7 source for all things Penn! Imagine us as your cool, connected friend who has eyes all over campus. The friend who knows everything going on at Penn, and wants you to know too. From immediate and relevant
              news, to the weird, funny things you see every day, Under The Button IS Penn online, and we’ll always be here to tell you what’s up, make you laugh and distract you from work — we promise.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sound like something you’re into? Apply to write for us! Under the Button is getting ready to accept applications for fall contributors.
            </p>
            <p>
              We pull from all over Penn — ALL years, ALL schools, NO experience necessary. If you love writing, if you’re a Penn expert, or if you’re looking for your place at Penn, this is it. UTB is it. Come see for yourself at our first general interest meeting:
              Thursday, January 22 at 8-9 p.m. at 4015 Walnut.
