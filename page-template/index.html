              <h1>The story of Jara feature title</h1>
              <p>The first step is the website ad: $10 for each post and $10 more every day to promote it. The cost adds up, but the payoff more than covers the investment. Jara Krys’s payoff comes at $300 per hour, non-negotiable. The next step is a mutual vetting by phone. Cops ask too much, and some men are just on the phone to get off on the sound of her voice. 

The man on the other end of Jara’s phone paid for three hours on the Friday of Labor Day weekend. He told her to meet him at a hotel on 17th Street.

When the three hours were up, Jara walked from the hotel back to her University City apartment with a stop at Wawa to pick up the essentials: spicy chicken fingers, Slim Jims, Red Vines and one doughnut. At home, she settled in for her version of the post-coital cigarette: multiplayer-online game Dota 2. Midway through her game, her phone rang. It was the man she just left sad-eyed in the hotel room.

“I want to see you again,” he said — right away.

He paid $1,200 for an overnight, and Jara abandoned her game to make her way back to the hotel.

“I only got two hours of sleep that night. I don’t know how I made it through the day,” Jara said the week after Labor Day. Not that she regretted it, she added, as she reclined in a chair, sipping iced tea, dressed in a tight striped shirt and tan jeans. Let Jara talk and she’ll go on tangents for hours, starting with a story of her childhood that reminds her of a friend that reminds her of a problem in the transgender community.

If Jara had followed her original plan, she’d be a senior in Penn’s Huntsman Program in International Studies and Business, set to graduate in May 2015. If Jara stayed as she was freshman year, she’d still be a man named Christian Jaramillo. Jara considers herself a work-in-progress, with a line-up of adjustments she wants to make—be it cheek injections or small breast implants—but that’s the fun of it.

“If you want to be an icon,” she said, “you have to start somewhere.”

 
	
**

Jara Krys grew up 15 minutes outside of the Las Vegas strip, born into a poor and sprawling family that, as a niece of hers put it, nurses a long-running mean streak. Jara, named Christian at birth, is the youngest of a mix of full and half-siblings. Her mother died when she was six; her father when she was 16.

Jara never let herself identify as anything other than a boy before college. Looking back, she describes her attitude as transphobic, disgusted as a child by trans porn she found on the computer of a much-older half-brother whom everyone in the family tacitly agreed was a pedophile. But she liked to put on her sister’s dresses and made female avatars for herself on online video games. As a very young child, she stripped the clothes off her Barbie dolls and marveled at their bodies’ flatness, wanting the same for herself. 

Her family noticed.

“When my dad would catch me being too feminine, he’d hit me for it,” she said. “Whenever I was acting like a woman they’d get mad at me.”

The depression that would follow Jara through college hit her when she was young. From fifth grade until high school, Jara’s worst moments included swallowing a handful of pills and putting a knife as far into her mouth as it would go. When she couldn’t forge meaningful relationships with her family, she turned to men: She lost her virginity at age 13 to a 16-year-old boy and ran away from home with a man nine years her senior when she was 14.

When her father died of a long-term illness, Jara moved in with her much-older sister and her sister’s husband. Jara was supposed to receive income from her father’s Social Security account, but says she never saw a dime of it. Her sister took it, claiming it as her due for housing Jara. During her senior year of high school, Jara moved into a place of her own.

Despite her home life, Jara was a model student in high school. She became salutatorian of her graduating class and spent her free time on her extracurriculars, policy debate and mock trial. Her friends and family who knew her at the time describe her as the personification of a pre-Ivy League student: consumed by school.

“His work ethic was just off-the-charts,” said Troi Chomas, who was Jara’s high school debate partner and is now a junior at Towson University in southern Maryland. While Troi supports Jara’s transition, she sometimes switches between male and female pronouns, especially when talking about their time in high school when she knew Jara as Christian. “He picked up policy the same year we were debating together, and we did really well because he worked his butt off. It was crazy.” 

Debate requires travel for tournaments; travel requires money. Jara secretly earned her extra money by taking up sex work for the first time, a younger boy selling herself —himself, at the time — to a consistent rotation of older men.

Post-graduation, she headed to her top choice: the Huntsman Program at the University of Pennsylvania, on full financial aid. Jara took off for Philadelphia, still a boy named Christian who was inclined to linger by the makeup aisle but didn’t know why.

For Jara, sex work isn’t selling her body: her body’s still hers, and what she does with it is her choice. Sex work is just using her talent.

“I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t enjoy it. I hate people who are like, ‘Only women who have nothing else to do, only women who are depressed with their lives do it,’” she said. “I feel so empowered.  I feel like a businesswoman. I’m getting somewhere. I can use it as capital to do other things.”

Jara talking about her escort work sounds like any other 20-something talking about their new startup. She’s conscious of how she markets her “brand” in, as she put it, a “highly-saturated market,” and just what kind of clients she wants to attract. 

“Wharton taught me how to be a proper sex worker,” she said, satisfied.

Delve a little deeper and the sex work industry is more than the stereotypical image of prostitutes lurking on the street. There are the girls who want a sugar daddy and get their payoff in luxury goods. Some sex workers, mostly those who work on the street, charge by act. Then there’s Jara’s type, who charge by the hour and usually use stage names, as Jara does. She speaks with derision of the girls who pride themselves on getting their customers out the door as soon as they can: Jara never goes under a full hour. She identifies as demisexual — someone who only enjoys sex within a relationship — and uses the hour to create a pseudo-relationship with her client. In the industry, what she offers is known as the “girlfriend experience.”

Jara’s clients don’t have much in common except for a desire for secrecy. There are the men who have her roleplay as a teacher, a daughter or a daughter’s best friend. There was the man with a missing arm and the man with abnormally short legs. A man who had always wanted to have sex with a transwoman confided to her that he could never be seen with one in public. One man looked about 80.

The economics of escort work makes for a hand-to-mouth lifestyle: Earn $1,000 one day and spend it on a New York City hotel to try to make $2,000 the next. Sometimes Jara is broke, sometimes she can splurge a new pair of shoes. What Jara saves from escorting will help pay for future surgeries: The breast implants and nose job she wants range from $2,000 to $6,000 and $5,000 to $10,000, respectively.

An ex-boyfriend remembers seeing what he described as “endless stacks of hundred-dollar bills” in her purse — and never paying for a date after their first.  Another ex admitted he wasn’t entirely happy with Jara’s line of work, but says he never said anything to her. On the upside, the ex added, “I get it for free. Awesome.”

The first time she told one of her best friends, Jake Heagy, about her work, Jara was so vague that it took a few back-and-forths by text for Jake to understand what she meant.

“I try to be supportive because I feel like not enough people will be supportive,” said Jake, who graduated from the University of Maryland in Baltimore County last spring. He and Jara met over the dating site OKCupid in fall of 2013, though there’s never been anything between them but friendship. “But I feel like she’s a better person than the job. And to me it feels demeaning.”

The high school Jara agreed with Jake. She was ashamed of her work and only did it because she felt like she didn’t have another option to get the money. Jara had to start accepting her identity as transgender to start to accepting her identity as a sex worker. The uproar around Miriam Weeks, a Duke University undergraduate who stars in porn films as “Belle Knox” to pay her college tuition and was “outed” by a fellow student in January 2014 liberated Jara: Finally, everyone was talking about it.

“We talk about these people being disgusting and the grunts of society, but for me it’s made me a woman,” Jara said. “I had to stop thinking about what society thought.”

The single piece of furniture in Jara’s living room is a TV, left on the carpeted floor because she’s afraid to mount it on the wall by herself and hasn’t gotten around to buying a stand for it. The only room in her one-person apartment that looks lived in is the bedroom, where the entire four-foot windowsill is covered in bottles and boxes of beauty products.

“I need some furniture,” she said. “I’m going to take a trip to IKEA — I’ve never been.”

She sat on her bed — a mattress on the floor — in a silk black-and-red robe with a turquoise bra peeking out, and pulled out her phone to look at the list she made of topics she didn’t want to forget to bring up.

 

Jara’s adolescent depression crept back in college. Her friends from freshman year remember her as always busy and always doing classwork—the model Penn student, passionate and driven. While the schoolwork didn’t bother her at first, she didn’t find a niche in the tight-knit Huntsman community: the students, she said, had affluence she couldn’t relate to. Her depression centered around her gender identity: The worse she felt, the more she hated her genitals. Looking in a mirror to see herself as a man made her feel sick.
	
Spring of freshman year, she walked into Counseling and Psychological Services without an appointment, suicidal and desperate to see anyone who had time. Haltingly, Jara told her therapist about how her depression seemed connected to her penis and how, above all, she wanted to get rid of it. 

That was normal, her therapist said, and Penn insurance even covered gender reassignment surgery.

“That day changed my life,” Jara said.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~TRANSITION VIDEO EMBEDDED HERE~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj3-YRMfDIY&index=4&list=UUz5_M2D9KEpQ3cXPW-Ol8Hg


Jara came back to Penn in the spring of sophomore year wearing feminine jeans and high heels, the beginning of her outward transition. She moved toward an androgynous gender before XXX more feminine. She transformed her old name, Christian Jaramillo, into her new name, Jara Krys. For a time, all she wanted was to pass unseen.

“I didn’t want people to talk about me, I didn’t want them to think about me, I didn’t want them to think about what was in my pants,” she said. “I didn’t want to hear them say ‘he.’”

But some professors and many of her classmates still called Jara “he,” despite her requests. When a professor used her old name on a PowerPoint to divide a class into groups, Jara pretended she hadn’t been assigned a group. After class, she spoke to the apologetic professor but walked out of the room humiliated.

Even before her outward transition began, Jara struggled to find her place in the Huntsman Program. XX By Jara’s telling, the program’s executive director, Inge Herman, seemed concerned about her from the start of freshman year, always asking Jara if she felt comfortable in the program. Eventually, Inge asked her point-blank if she would consider leaving because the program didn’t seem to be the right fit, Jara said. PUTACADEMICSHERE?

Those conversations, Inge said in an interview, are common with students having academic problems. 

TRANS One day freshman year, Jara was sitting alone when a Huntsman classmate walked up to her and asked her if everything was all right. Confused, she asked, “Is there something wrong?”

“I shouldn’t be telling you this,” Jara remembers him saying, “but Inge told us a lot in the lounge.”

Gathered in the lounge, he told her, Inge told the other Huntsman students that Jara’s parents had both died. She told them that Jara’s sister had taken her social security money, something Jara only revealed to Penn’s Student Financial Services because she needed money and had to explain why she was applying as an independent student.

The student, who requested anonymity, said he doesn’t remember the exact conversation or whether or not Inge was there. He does remember discussing Jara’s personal life with four or five other students in the lounge and telling Jara about the conversation. Another Huntsman student, however, remembers a conversation with Inge specifically about Jara’s personal life during their freshman year.

“She told me something along the lines of Christian’s family being addicted to some type of substance, and we should have grace dealing with her because it’s obviously a pretty big thing to have happened at 18 years old,” said the student, who wished to remain anonymous. “Christian was a little bit more quiet, a little bit more reserved with us, and we didn’t know why.”

Inge said that Jara did talk to her about her life circumstances, and that she had only shared details in response to students asking why Jara didn’t spend more time with the other students. Many students, said Huntsman Program faculty director Janice Bellace, knew about it already. 

“I’m sure I shared that Christian had a tough life with both his parents dying and his sister and he not speaking so that it made even more sense to reach out,” Inge said. “It’s for the benefit of the student. I never talk to any student about confidential information when it regards academics, or health, or anything like that.”

Whatever Inge’s intentions may have been, Jara never felt comfortable again in the tight-knit Huntsman program.

Jara’s closest friends at Penn — who weren’t in the Huntsman program — knew about her depression but felt ill-equipped to help her. At her lowest points, food rotted in her fridge for months. When her table didn’t have any more space on it, she pushed the trash onto the floor. She missed exams and was too embarrassed to say why. Every day, she asked herself, Why am I even here? She dropped classes until she was put on academic probation.

Jara snapped in the dark stairs of Harnwell College House in February 2014. She hurled her phone down the stairs and watched it shatter. The next morning, she emailed her College adviser, Katrina Glanzer.

“I really want to take a break from school, I am not in the right mindset and things are not going well. Would it be too late for this semester?” Jara wrote in a Feb. 3 email. “I really just need to stop doing my studies for a bit and concentrate on something else.”

Katrina replied half an hour later.

“I think a leave is a good idea,” Katrina said in the email. “I know it's been hard to focus on school and Penn will always be here for you to return to.”

Jara secured an OK from her therapist with her earliest possible return date in the spring of 2015. With $2,000 in her bank account, she took off for New York City to do full-time sex work.

**

As of early September, Jara is the proud owner of a brand new Pennsylvania drivers’ license with a new photo, her new name and an “F” next to sex, acquired with the help of XX the Mazzoni Center in Philadelphia to file the necessary paperwork. The laws for changing one’s sex vary state-to-state: In Pennsylvania, a court only requires a note from a doctor or counselor saying a person is transitioning and he or she now identifies as a different sex.  Other states like X require physical genitalia—artificial or otherwise—to reassign sex.

Despite what she told her therapist that day freshman year, Jara hasn’t yet hasn’t yet cut “it” out and isn’t sure that she wants to. Unlike freshman year, she’s comfortable with her penis. Having it doesn’t make her feel any less feminine.
	
“A lot of my trans sisters feel shame when they’re young, like they’re born in the wrong body,” Jara said. “The only reason you feel like you’re born in the wrong body is society tells you so—not because you are.”

 

Most of her family knows about her transition by now, said her 17-year-old niece, Maria Hernandez—the only member of Jara’s family who responded to multiple interview requests. A few of them accept it. Most don’t and still refer to Jara as a man.

“What stands out to me is how proud she is that she’s transgender,” Maria said. “She thinks it’s funny when people try staring at her. She’s like, ‘These people are staring at me because they know I’m so hot.’ It’s probably true.”

Jara’s time off from Penn helped accomplish what she needed to: it’s allowed her to transition without the constant fear of judgment. At Penn, she timed her changes by semester, afraid that people would judge her for any drastic change. She didn’t wear a bra. Her voice stayed low. Instead of the carefully-drawn on makeup she wears now, she stuck to simple foundation.

“I thought I was so free at Penn, but when I got out of Penn and wasn’t going to school, I realized there was so much I wasn’t doing and so much I could’ve changed that I didn’t because I was scared of what people would think,” she said. “I think I’ve come to the point that when I do go back to school I wouldn’t care anymore.”

After graduating, Jara wants to start a non-gendered clothing company. Not baggy unisex clothes, she clarified quickly, but a place where clothes aren’t sectioned off by gender. She wants to start a nonprofit for sex workers that would advocate for their rights, provide support and be an alternative to turn to instead of law enforcement. Through her organization, the community would come to see sex workers as more than just sex workers: They would be people with interests, families and talents who also happened to do sex work. Sex work, Jara said, shouldn’t define people.

Or maybe she could be an international escort as a full-time job, making hundreds of thousands of dollars, a salary rivaling that of her Wharton peers on Wall Street.

“It seems egotistic,” she said, “but I want to be an icon for trans rights and rights of sex workers.

Picture this: Jara struts down a catwalk, dressed, in her own words, like a vixen. Slowly, she sheds her outer clothes. She takes off her bra to reveal small, nipple-free breasts. Finally, she reveals her lower half: flat and smooth like the Barbie dolls she used to play with. Whether she gets to the lower half by surgery or by an artificial covering, she still wants to do the show one day.

“I want to say fuck you, this is who I am, this is what I want. This is how I identify,” she said. “I want to stun people.”
