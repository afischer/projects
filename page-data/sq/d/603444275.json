My name is Kevin Zhou, and I am running for your UA College Representative. Having served on the UA in the last two years, I have involved myself in many important issues on campus related to access and equity for minority students, academic accommodations, mental health resources, and more. As the chair of the United Minorities Council, I led the effort in increasing funding for all cultural groups by securing a $6000 annual allocation for 6B as well as the push for the expansion of minority spaces on campus beyond the basement of Arch. I am also pursuing the creation of a University-wide policy mandating professors to give students make-up midterms in case of legitimate absences due to illness, family emergency, religious reasons, or other unexpected events. The embedded CAPS model I championed for freshmen year is also currently expanding across campus, piloted by Wharton but spreading to other schools as well. All of my initiatives focus on hearing all voices on campus, understanding diverse student needs, and creating tangible changes in response.

As I run this third time, I plan on continuing this work. However, it has come to my attention that the majority of the student body does not actually know what the UA does and what we work on. The UA is seen as an organization that is more concerned about airport shuttle sales than the advocacy of the student body. I want to ensure that the student body knows that is false with periodical publications of the UA's projects roughly 4 times a school year and by widely disseminating a UA feedback form, so students know that the UA actually works for them. Moreover, I would like to advocate for all students to have equal access at Penn, which is not the case. Wharton students have more University privileges that College students and that is not equitable.

My name is Mary Sadallah and I’m an Economics major from South Jersey. For the past year, I’ve been fortunate enough to serve as an Associate Member on the Undergraduate Assembly. My chief focus has been to integrate wellness into university life (mainly through the expansion of the Embedded CAPS Model that has been implemented in Wharton) because at Penn, we tend to see ourselves as students first and people second. To combat this culture, I believe that wellness must be tailored to us and made equally accessible. The UA has also afforded me the opportunity to advocate for members of underrepresented groups on campus. I’ve worked alongside the Cultural Resource Centers to plan programming that celebrates student diversity and engineered solutions to challenges faced by the FGLI community. Most importantly, I’ve worked to realize that my voice, as that of a minority and FGLI student, demands to be heard. A vote for Mary is a vote that carries the weight of making all-inclusive change.

Specifically looking at student complaints about the ground floor's bathrooms and conditions. Another project I hope to continue is the creation of a subsidy program for FGLI Students. Meeting with the Deputy Executive Director of CAPS, Dr.Meeta Kumar, to learn about the CAPS model and partnering up to look for solutions for FGLI students.  The UA has been an integral part of my experience here at Penn, especially listening to students concerns about Penn and I would love to continue this conversation.
