My time on the Board allowed me to learn about the roles and responsibilities of our organization, and I hope to utilize these experiences to create an even more inclusive, constructive, and creative Board for the upcoming semesters. The goal for this upcoming year is: better (and more!) giveaways, increased inclusivity at all events, organized partnerships with existing clubs on campus, and MORE FREE MERCH! I’m so excited to see what our sophomore year has in store for us, and remember, to those who said that we couldn’t, YES WE KHAN!","endorsements":"","image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUDAv/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAECAP/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABtz9sBpOGIQudwP8A/8QAHBAAAwABBQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQIDAAQREzEz/9oACAEBAAEFAj1J6mmWuJYX4cRw63O96eenchP/xAAUEQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg/9oACAEDAQE/AR//xAAWEQADAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARD/2gAIAQIBAT8BrP/EAB8QAAIBAwUBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhEScQMQISIxQf/aAAgBAQAGPwIVz6v5TanrIyfKZciRp4Hk/8QAHBABAAMBAAMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAQARITEQQaHB/9oACAEBAAE/IcNC0JR9Ro48cZaciYWSj8gPixrPrJ9qDgx//9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABBj5/z/xAAZEQADAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAREQMUH/2gAIAQMBAT8QUjuH0Wj/xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARExEP/aAAgBAgEBPxCOqcWI0f/EABwQAQEBAAMAAwAAAAAAAAAAAAERACFRcTFBof/aAAgBAQABPxBJUgg/bM3JUwLlOdMXTuB+D1w6OYBFEt6TW1e4iPTrEtA8A3ALS3PuCtLfw3//2Q==","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/6e63d/khan.jpg","srcSet":"/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/b315d/khan.jpg 100w,\n/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/8295c/khan.jpg 200w,\n/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/6e63d/khan.jpg 400w,\n/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/7b2a1/khan.jpg 600w,\n/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/d1f84/khan.jpg 800w,\n/static/e5ddc5138661bef66b438f727bc052d6/5926f/khan.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}}}],"Nursing_Chair":[{"name":"Danielle Lo","statement":"To my fellow Nursing classmates: this past year, I have had the great pleasure of serving as your Nursing Chair.
