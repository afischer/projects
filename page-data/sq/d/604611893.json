Despite serving as a Class Officer throughout high school, I chose not to run for Class Board last year because I wasn’t confident posing solutions without first understanding what needed to be improved. Now, as a Wharton Ambassador having lived at Penn for (almost) a year, I am eager to implement new initiatives and enhance our educational, co-curricular, and social experiences. I absolutely love Penn and am immensely grateful for my education, so I want to make this year - albeit online - special and memorable for the class of 2023.","instagram_handle":"dani.duff","name":"Dani Duffalo","platform_points":["Maintain accessible free COVID testing on campus throughout the year","Implement a program through which students can form online study groups and meet peers in their classes; Adapt the Take Your Professor to Lunch Program to an online platform","Partner with local restaurants and food trucks to accept dining dollars; Allow meal swipes at Houston Hall (post-COVID)","Work on acquiring student government funding for pre-professional clubs","Improve and increase outdoor seating on and around Locust Walk","Work with mental health and wellness groups on campus to ensure easily accessible resources for all students"],"youtube_video_url":null},{"campaign_website":"https://qrco.de/sheumaker","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/carson.sheumaker/","image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/6e63d/carson-sheumaker.jpg","srcSet":"/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/b315d/carson-sheumaker.jpg 100w,\n/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/8295c/carson-sheumaker.jpg 200w,\n/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/6e63d/carson-sheumaker.jpg 400w,\n/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/7b2a1/carson-sheumaker.jpg 600w,\n/static/47893ea7b41f2a26878f97b50903918c/6b9fc/carson-sheumaker.jpg 607w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"introduction":"Hey guys, I'm Carson Sheumaker.
