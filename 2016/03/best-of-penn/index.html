                            Has Fling weekend suddenly turned you into an introvert? Do you need to escape the capitalist bubble that tried to sell you concert tickets you didn’t know you wanted? Now is a good time to remember that two blocks west of campus lies a magical green land called Clark Park.
 
                            Upon walking through the park’s gates, you’ll notice a kiosk teaching you about what trees are giving you the shade you need to recover from your hangover. They even list the trees that are no longer with us. Take a moment to yourself to remember the fallen trees and to curse humanity. Wander a little farther into the park towards the playground. Since you’ve ventured into “real” West Philly you definitely won’t run into anyone when you decide to test whether swings are more fun than downtowns.
                             
                            Take another moment to grab a coffee at Green Line Café across the street and enjoy it on one of Clark Park’s bright orange lawn chairs. There’s no Wifi in Green Line— they’re basically begging you to unplug and experience the great outdoors.

                           Street took some creative liberty with our definition of best “fro–yo/ice cream” and went with Capogiro’s delicious gelato. Perhaps a more inclusive title for this category would’ve been “best frozen dairy concoction,” but we don’t have time to be PC about our desserts because we’re too busy ciao–ing down. Capo’s gelato reminds this us of hot summer afternoons at the gelaterias in the suburbs outside Milan. Their overstuffed cups of gelato with colored spoons nestled between scoops are almost indistinguishable in appearance and taste from the ones you’ll get if you study abroad in Florence or Rome. You’ll be transported to sunny Italy as you SABS at the tables outside on Walnut. With the freedom to try different combinations of flavors and the opportunity to learn some Italian food vocabulary, Capogiro not only offers scrumptious frozen treats but also an authentic and, for some, nostalgic experience.

You've entered the establishment and passed the guy you used to hook up with sitting across from his new girlfriend as well as that group of sorority girls who can't even collectively finish a single bagel. You've endured awkwardly standing at the back of the line, dodging people going to the bathroom, the barista delivering coffee and the fridge door. Now there's only one person in front of you and he’s already ordered, so it should only be another half hour before you can get your latte. But oh shit. No cash. You're either ordering 5 coffees, a huge bag of granola and some weird tofu salad to make the $10 credit card minimum, or you’re left empty handed with nothing but regrets.

Literally. Everyone. Goes there. Arrive at 9am to get that prime SABS spot at the head of the table and a breakfast sandwich (underrated). Keep getting coffee. Get a salad or a sandwich if the person whose eye you’re trying to catch doesn’t show up by lunchtime. And don't worry, if, by some weird twist of fate, you don't run into the person you're stalking, he/ she probably isn’t cool enough for you anyway.

Additionally, the Rotunda (or, “the Tund” as we are now calling it #spreadtheword) includes space for seating (the floor) and a catering option. The Tund doubles as a church/community center, giving it both divinity and humility. Call in advance because it usually books up with Wharton networking events and Chance the Rapper performances. DM Amy G. for details. Odds you do it. You won’t.

Their huevos rancheros are so good that it took everything within our power not to get down on one knee and propose to the chef, the waitress, and the stove. They make vegetables, put them in a skillet, cover them in cheese, and give you an excuse to eat melted cheese for breakfast. They make French toast and then cover it in marshmallows. They even have a tofu scramble, if you’re into that kind of thing. Oh, and it’s a BYO. Why are you still reading this? Go.

Give your pussy a “Full Groom” or a less timely “Neatn’ Up”; however, prices do change depending on hair length! Definitely don’t forget about your bone–loving spirit animal either: get a “Teeth Cleaning” for just $10! However, if you’ve got a stinky Weiner dog, you’ll be begging to add on a “De-Skunker” treatment to clean up that bone! Also be sure to get a “Nail Clip” or “Nail Grind" if you’re trying to get your paws on some real good meat anytime soon. Additionally, you can top off a service for just $5 with a “Sanitary Trim” for those hard to reach crevices or even an “Anal Gland Release” on a simply shitty day. Don’t have much time? Treat yourself to the “Express Service” and call it a quickie.

The minute they ask you to make a dinner reservation you’re presented with a rare opportunity: impress your ‘rents with how cultured you are, and eat a meal that amounts to your food budget for the whole week completely for free. Parc is easily the best restaurant for achieving both of these goals. Facing the twinkling lights of Rittenhouse Square, Parc wins for its atmosphere as much as it does for its food. The French restaurant is filled with decorations reminiscent of Paris and is quiet enough to admit to your parents that you still don’t have a boyfriend yet. The food itself is a showstopper. Treat yourself to the cheesiest French onion soup you could never eat in front of your betchy srat sisters and don’t skip the profiteroles for dessert. You’ll (shockingly) never want your parents to leave.

Sometimes you’re just struck by a sudden, inescapable fear of the future and all you want is Chipotle and a cocoon of blankets, not bankers and a collection of half–sober Intagram pics.  Maybe it was realizing your LinkedIn profile is underdeveloped or trying to forecast your GPA (please cease and desist), but the emotional tailspin can strike at the most inopportune times.  Honestly, falling into the emotional void is totally valid, and not only will this excuse always work because, well, half of your friends are probably trying to party through it, but just maybe you can turn what was going to be a lame-ass pregame into chilling with people who can drag you out of the abyss.  Not only is this excuse probably ~too real~ and super effective, but it’s also fun to text sans explanation.

                            I got a boner in front of my thesis advisor.

                            I needed to stall; it was one of those weird warm winter days where I could wear shorts, and I absolutely could not stand up at that moment. The topic of conversation switched to my going to a Bruce Springsteen concert, which, given my fanaticism, absolutely did not help things. Then we talked about a trip Levendusky took to New York, which meant talking about Hamilton and pizza, which also didn’t help. Eventually, things died down, but I still feel like a bar mitzvah boy at our weekly thesis meeting.

Don’t hate on the non–breakfast sandwiches, as selections like the eggplant spinach parm are especially lit. And for fuck’s sake make sure that you have some cash on hand.

                            Pretty much everyone at Penn is busy as fuck at least 94% of the time, and the environment we live in has us constantly seeking out ways to save hours or even minutes, whether we notice it or not. We take 2 p.m. sober shortcuts through those diagonal Highrise Field pathways to save time going to class just as we take 2 a.m. drunk/blazed shortcuts through the Chancellor backlot to get to and from Wishbone. When we rally during days/nights out, we even try to save time with all those annoyingly necessary bodily functions like eating and peeing. 

                            That’s why we go to Wawa and that’s why we publicly urinate. Here’s a game–changing strategy on how to do both.

                            1. Order your sandwich and pay for it.

                            2. Walk outside, turn southwards (like you’re going to Leidy for BIOL101, you probably only went to lecture once so just try to remember that one time in your fucked–up state).

                            3. Take a quick turn onto Woodland Walk into that office building’s little corridor.

                            4. Take care of business.

                            5. Go back and pick up your sandwich. It’s probably ready by now.

                            6. Thank me when you’re sober again.

                            Let Street put this simply: Bui's will give you life. Are you really hungover? Get a Bui's breakfast sandwich. Have a 9 am recitation and need something to give you meaning and get you through a bitchy TA's morning diatribe? Get a Bui's breakfast sandwich. 

                            Penn's students introduction to Bui's seems to be pretty universal; it's Saturday, and you're walking down 38th and Spruce, to find that it's the only food truck available. You're dehydrated and you're dead, and you don't know what to order. But, when you look at the menu, you spot The Hangover Special, a sausage, ham, egg and cheese sandwich that will carry you through the day. It includes a gatorade. You then find out that you can text Bui your order ahead. Your heart has been stolen. 

                            As college students, we look to find for all–encompassing quick fixes. Bui's breakfast sandwiches are this precisely: they get you through any day and every occasion. The Vietnamese couple that runs this truck  are a pair of homies who have you covered. And not only is the food delicious, but you will always find a friendly, familiar  face in a sea of midterm sadness waiting for you at this truck.

                            Not everyone has someone picking up the tab for the magic “fake money” that gets attached to your student bill, but for those lucky individuals who do, many can think of countless time that that mystical money source in the sky swooped in to save the day. Like that time you made the mistake of wearing gray one hot, humid September morning and had to bursar a replacement tee on your way to class, or that month that you spent all of your “real money” on downtowns, alcohol, and $15 Sweetgreen salads and had to subsist on Frontera and Houston for the rest of the month. But nothing quite compares to bursar’s greatest gift: funding your emergency contraceptive at SHS. So next time “the condom breaks,” don’t shell out $60 bucks and your dignity buying Plan B in the sceney joint that is CVS. Charge that lil pill to bursar. And, don’t worry when your parents pay the bill, all they’ll see is “SHS fee” not “last night’s drunken mistake.”So Bursar, you enigmatic superhero you, thank you for being more reliable than condoms, and more generous than that fuckboy who didn’t even offer to split it $30/$30. we love you, and are forever in your debt.

                            Everyone has an opinion on everything these days. "I hate boys in joggers" or "the Chipotle here sucks" (unanimous vote.) It's hard to find consistency in this ever populated and fast moving world. This is why places like Dim Sum Garden are revered as heavenly escapes for the average turmoiled student. A scenario doesn't exist where an individual claims to dislike DSG. And you know why? Because DSG is consistently there for us, whether we need a back room for drinking too much Franzia or simply need to be comforted by a hot, crispy scallion pancake after a long day of avoiding human contact on Locust Walk. Dim Sum is the reason you can forget that Frontera ran out of shrimp again, or that your creepy secret crush referred to you as "the homie" last night. Dim Sum won't forget to get your number, put a mouse in your dorm room or punch you in the face during pledging. It's just going to aggressively sit you down and give you exactly what you asked for, no strings attached. What other restaurant will treat you like Belle in the "Be Our Guest" scene of Beauty and the Beast? And isn't that how every diner deserves to be treated? At the end of the day, the cynic in me believes you can't count on most things in life. But a soup dumpling turned this cynic into an optimist. In Dim Sum we trust. And so we beat on, boats against the current, with DSG as our sails.

                            The best place on campus to take a hot selfie is without a doubt the basement of VP bathrooms. They have everything you need to maximize your like to minute ratio. The weird lighting will create super flattering shadows that bring out the dark bags under your eyes. Be sure to use Valencia with just a hint of Lux to get that perfect glow. The VP geotag will let everyone know just how hard you’re studying so they feel inferior while wasting their time checking insta. In case you're having caption–writer's block, the foul atmosphere will provide the perfect inspiration for ambiance hashtags #shitonthewalls #nohotwater #holdyourbreath. The smiling poop emoji will never be more appropriate. Make sure you tag and DM the pic to @uofpenn to remind them of the cruel and unusual suffering a College student must go through to get a good smizing pic. Also you should probably tag illustrious SAS alumni @ElizabethBanks, @JohnLegend and @ToryBurch in a desperate plea for non–Wharton donations.

                            Although a bit out of the way on your morning walk to class, Green Line on 42nd and Baltimore is your ideal Sunday morning destination. Just far enough away from campus, you can get your necessary caffeine and finish the work you put off all weekend without running into everyone you know. Secluding yourself away on Baltimore takes away all distractions besides the allure of Clark Park outside Green Line’s window. Most importantly this non-WiFi-friendly café makes you sacrifice your Internet, which we really think is a blessing because coffee tastes a lot more bitter when you are attacked with unwanted emails and Facebook notifications. Make sure you grab a Weckerly’s ice cream sandwich from the fridge, a seat outside, and make sure to pet every dog that walks by the park.
