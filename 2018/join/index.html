            DP Analytics is a department undergoing a lot of transformation, and we're ready to make big moves to help propel the DP into the digital-first age.

          <p>
            Using statistical software and coding languages like R and Python, the Analytics Department works on both the editorial and business sides of the operation to use stores of data in order to track our readership numbers, understand our audience, predict advertising trends, and pursue new content opportunities.

            We are a financially independent organization; there's no better place on campus where your work can directly affect a real business.
