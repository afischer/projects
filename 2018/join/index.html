            The Daily Pennsylvanian is looking for creative, engaging and dedicated writers to pen weekly or biweekly columns for Penn's independent student newspaper.
            The best columnists do more than tell stories or argue their opinions &mdash; they identify topics relevant to the Penn community.
            Your writing and reporting skills will improve tremendously, and you will have the rare opportunity to reach thousands of people with every column you write.

            Our photographers use the latest DSLR cameras and lenses to cover major events on campus and across the country.
            Our staff have shot famous figures among the likes of Joe Biden and Usain Bolt, stood front row at Made in America, and traveled for special events including presidential campaigns and NCAA tournaments.
            Being a photojournalist for the DP also gives you the opportunity to create and expand your portfolio, with the chance to practice with photo-editing software including Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom.
          </p>

            No experience or equipment is required, just a desire to learn photography.

            DP Analytics is a department undergoing a lot of transformation, and we're ready to make big moves to help propel the DP into the digital-first age.
            Using statistical software and coding languages like R and Python, the Analytics Department works on both the editorial and business sides of the operation to use stores of data in order to track our readership numbers, understand our audience, predict advertising trends, and pursue new content opportunities.
            We are a financially independent organization; there's no better place on campus where your work can directly affect a real business.
