        <h3>END OF YEAR AWARDS</h3>
        <p>
            It's been a fantastic year for Penn Athletics to date. The school has brought in five team league championships - with
            two more potentially coming from women's lacrosse and baseball. Individuals from women's squash, cross country, fencing
            and more have dominated on the national stage. Decades-long title droughts have been broken; equally lengthy individual 
            records have fallen.

             Sure, Penn men’s basketball had the best story this year. But when it comes to dominance on the national stage, there’s just no match for 
             Karin Corbett’s women’s lacrosse program. 
            </p> 
            <p>
             This team has long been a juggernaut, having won 10 of the past 11 Ivy League championships, 
             including three NCAA Final Four appearances in that span. But just because the success has become so expected year after year doesn’t make it 
             any less impressive. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             Holding a stellar 11-2 record including an unblemished 5-0 Ivy League mark, the No. 10 Quakers own quality non
             conference wins over schools like Johns Hopkins and Duke to match their Ivy League dominance and look well on their way to Corbett’s 11th 
             conference title. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             But just as impressive as the team success have been the individuals behind it. Freshman midfielder Zoe Belodeau has put up 
             outrageous numbers in her debut season, already 15 points ahead of Erin Brennan’s previous Penn single-season rookie points record of 45.
            </p>
            <p>  
             As if that wasn’t impressive enough, sophomore Gabby Rosenzweig is on pace to break a bigger school record, only 24 points shy of Nina
             Corcoran’s single-season record of 85 with a minimum of four games remaining. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             With elite star players and the team results to match, Penn women’s lacrosse is the top squad of the year in Penn sports.

             Penn women’s track and field ran over the opposition at this year’s Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships in February, capturing the team’s first Heps win since 1996. With a total of 137 points, the Quakers completely outperformed the seven other Ivy teams, beating second-place Harvard by 32 points.


            </p> 
            <p>
             The victory came both on the track and in the field events, as the Red and Blue notched six individual event wins, the most by a Penn team at the Heps since 1988. The Quakers benefited from strong performances up and down the roster, aided by both veterans and rookies.
            </p>
            <p>  
             
The big winner of the weekend was superstar Abby Hong, who won both the 3000-meter and 5000m races for the Red and Blue. The senior continued her dominance in the long distance contests, setting a school record by four seconds in the latter.
 
            </p>
            <p>  
For the first time since 1985, the Red and Blue won the 4x800m relay. The team of senior Gina Alm and sophomores Mikayla Schneider, Nia Akins, and Katie DeVore put up a time of 8:47.87 to outpace the competition and earn the win.
            </p>
            <p>  
 Freshman Uchechi Nwogwugwu took first in the 500m with a time of 1:13.09, good enough for fifth in program history.
            </p>
            <p>  
In the field, Penn took first in two events for the first time in program history, with two juniors claiming the victories. Rachel Lee Wilson took first in the weight throw with a mark of 18.70m, and Anna Peyton Malizia set a new school record with her high jump height of 1.80m.            
            </p>
            <p>
                With big efforts from athletes of from years, the entire women’s track and field team came together for a historic and dominant win.

             A coach usually wins an end of the year award when he or she wins a championship or vastly improves his or her team’s performance.
            </p> 
            <p>
             Penn men’s basketball coach Steve Donahue did both.
            </p>
            <p>  
             In just his third year, he led the Quakers to their first Ivy League championship since 2007 after fourth and fifth-place finishes over the 
             last two seasons. In fact, since its 0-6 start in Ivy play last year, Penn has won 18 of 23 Ivy League games.
            </p>
            <p>  
             However, it is not just the improvement in overall record that speaks to why Donahue deserves “Best Coach.” He is also a master at
             manipulating the rotation. While the starting lineup remained the same, Donahue often experimented with whom he brought off the bench.
            </p>
            <p>  
             In many games, unexpected contributors propelled Penn to victory. Whether it was senior Sam Jones’ 15 point outburst against Dayton, junior
             Jake Silpe’s timely threes at Dartmouth, or sophomore Devon Goodman’s 23 points at Columbia, Donahue was never afraid to give seldom used
             players big minutes when they earned it. Constantly changing the rotation allowed Donahue to find the perfect bench combination come 
             tournament time.
            </p>
            <p>  
             By the end of the year, Penn arguably had the most talented bench in the Ivy League. Goodman and sharp-shooting senior Caleb Wood 
             consistently provided instant offense and were instrumental throughout Penn’s run to the NCAA tournament.
            </p>
            <p>  
             Furthermore, he also led the Quakers’ resurgence largely without a freshman class. Guards Jelani Williams, a projected starter, and Eddie
             Scott missed most of the season with injuries while forward Jarrod Simmons fell out of the rotation.
            </p>
            <p>  
             Donahue may not be the only Penn coach to win an Ivy League championship this year, but none was more responsible to his team’s success than 
             the reigning Ivy League Coach of the Year.

             Penn women’s track and field ran over the opposition at this year’s Ivy League Indoor Heptagonal Championships in February, capturing the team’s first Heps win since 1996. With a total of 137 points, the Quakers completely outperformed the seven other Ivy teams, beating second-place Harvard by 32 points.
            </p> 
            <p>
             The victory came both on the track and in the field events, as the Red and Blue notched six individual event wins, the most by a Penn team at the Heps since 1988. The Quakers benefited from strong performances up and down the roster, aided by both veterans and rookies.
            </p>
            <p>  
             
The big winner of the weekend was superstar Abby Hong, who won both the 3000-meter and 5000m races for the Red and Blue. The senior continued her dominance in the long distance contests, setting a school record by four seconds in the latter.
 
            </p>
            <p>  
For the first time since 1985, the Red and Blue won the 4x800m relay. The team of senior Gina Alm and sophomores Mikayla Schneider, Nia Akins, and Katie DeVore put up a time of 8:47.87 to outpace the competition and earn the win.
            </p>
            <p>  
 Freshman Uchechi Nwogwugwu took first in the 500m with a time of 1:13.09, good enough for fifth in program history.
            </p>
            <p>  
In the field, Penn took first in two events for the first time in program history, with two juniors claiming the victories. Rachel Lee Wilson took first in the weight throw with a mark of 18.70m, and Anna Peyton Malizia set a new school record with her high jump height of 1.80m.            
            </p>
            <p>
                With big efforts from athletes of from years, the entire women’s track and field team came together for a historic and dominant win.

             Sure, Penn men’s basketball had the best story this year. But when it comes to dominance on the national stage, there’s just no match for 
             Karin Corbett’s women’s lacrosse program. 
            </p> 
            <p>
             This team has long been a juggernaut, having won 10 of the past 11 Ivy League championships, 
             including three NCAA Final Four appearances in that span. But just because the success has become so expected year after year doesn’t make it 
             any less impressive. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             Holding a stellar 11-2 record including an unblemished 5-0 Ivy League mark, the No. 10 Quakers own quality non
             conference wins over schools like Johns Hopkins and Duke to match their Ivy League dominance and look well on their way to Corbett’s 11th 
             conference title. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             But just as impressive as the team success have been the individuals behind it. Freshman midfielder Zoe Belodeau has put up 
             outrageous numbers in her debut season, already 15 points ahead of Erin Brennan’s previous Penn single-season rookie points record of 45.
            </p>
            <p>  
             As if that wasn’t impressive enough, sophomore Gabby Rosenzweig is on pace to break a bigger school record, only 24 points shy of Nina
             Corcoran’s single-season record of 85 with a minimum of four games remaining. 
            </p>
            <p>  
             With elite star players and the team results to match, Penn women’s lacrosse is the top squad of the year in Penn sports.
