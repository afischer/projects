Restricting access to a vital study space will not benefit our mental health.

As a UA College Representative, I would work directly with Dr.Dubé, our new Chief Wellness Officer, to ensure that students are well represented at all levels regarding decisions impacting our mental health. Together, we can work towards achieving shorter wait times and increased accessibility of CAPS, finding innovative ways to combat “Penn face”, and collaborate to help decrease the competitiveness of the club recruitment process.

I’ve only been here for a month, but in that time I’ve come up with a few tangible propositions that I think I could work toward with our administration. Allocating funding for water coolers to lounges, securing free printing for the entirety of the university, and creating bonding events with free food for our class are just some of the things I’ll work towards as your president.
