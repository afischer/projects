              <p>In February, the Philadelphia Eagles won the Super Bowl for the first time in history. On the night of the Eagles win, herds of Penn students paraded to Center City to join the chaotic celebration, which saw people climbing lamp posts and flipping cars. Philadelphia later scheduled a parade to honor the Eagles' homecoming, prompting local schools and colleges to close for the day. After a student petition that garnered over 3,000 signatures, Penn joined the other schools in suspending operations for the day. With the day off, Penn students flocked to the historic parade to catch a glimpse of the football team, joining 700,000 Eagles fans and Philadelphia natives.</p>

              <p>Since the start of fall semester, Penn has seen major changes to on-campus housing. In September, Penn announced that sophomores must live on campus starting in fall 2021. In October, Penn announced that the Quad will undergo a renovation for the first time in 20 years. The same month, nearly two dozen rooms in the Quad experienced mold problems, forcing students to relocate. Later in October, Penn announced that it will install air conditioning in two college houses next summer, after students slept in lounges to escape the extreme September heat. Most recently, in December, Penn began construction on its record-breaking $163 million dorm, New College House West, which is slated to open in 2021.</p>

              <p>After the midterm elections on Nov. 6, Penn's political groups had something to cheer about. Democrats reclaimed control of the House of Representatives, buoyed by crucial races that Penn Democrats canvassed in. Republicans also maintained their hold on the Senate, granting Penn College Republicans optimism for the next two years. In the weeks leading up to election day, students across the political spectrum advocated for a nonpartisan get-out-the-vote campaign, which ultimately resulted in Penn students voting in record high numbers â€” Pennâ€™s voter turnout for the Nov. 6 elections was higher than that of any midterm election in the past 12 years. Nationwide, multiple Penn grads were also elected to Congress.</p>

              <p>In early January, former College sophomore Blaze Bernstein went missing over winter break at his home in California. Days later, after his disappearance captured national attention, Bernsteinâ€™s body was found in a park near his house. Bernsteinâ€™s former high school classmate was later charged with the murder. On campus, students and faculty members mourned his death and honored his legacy. Bernstein, a pre-medical student studying psychology, was involved with several publications and had been elected managing editor of the food magazine Penn Appetit before winter break. After reports surfaced that his alleged killer had ties to a Neo-Nazi group, a judge added a hate crime enhancement to the murder charge in August. The alleged killer is now being held without bail, awaiting the trial. </p>
