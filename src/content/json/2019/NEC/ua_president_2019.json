    "statement": "Real change isn't achieved overnight, but there are concrete steps to get there. Throughout my past 3 years on the UA, I have shown that this tangible change is possible not just with passion, but with the correct ambition and determination to see it through. As UA President, I want to continue to challenge the status quo and challenge our members to support you, the student body, at a new level.<br><br>My joint-platform is based on 5 Pillars: Transparency, Equity & Representation, Sustainability, Wellness, and Modern Infrastructure. An overarching theme is student engagement, and as President I want to continue to build on forums like UA Steering, town halls and focus groups, to enhance collaboration among student leaders, and move from discussions to tangible actions items with administration.<br><br>Our record shows this works. From directly working with administrators on the creation of the new PennTransit-App that allows students to request transportation on and off-campus for free, to personally creating 360Â°-Views of Campus Dorms for Campus-Express, to implementing new signage in all Dining Halls on sustainable food disposal, and developing mindfulness-spaces in centralized locations like Houston Hall, I will continue to lead the UA to tangible change for you as UA President.",
