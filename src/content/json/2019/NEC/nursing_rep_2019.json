  "statement": "Hi friends! I am so excited to announce my candidacy for Nursing Representative on the Undergraduate Assembly! For the past year, I have had the pleasure of serving as an Associate Member on the UA working on numerous projects to benefit student’s academic and social lives, as well as striving to improve mental health on campus through collaborations with the Tutoring Center, Weingarten Learning Center, and School of Nursing.<br><br>If I were to be elected as your Nursing Representative, I would continue to fight for change and students’ rights on campus with projects such as lobbying for standardized clinical costs, more transparent financial aid statements, and healthcare-specific mental health resources on campus. Penn Nursing prides itself on being the best, but there is so much more that needs to be done. Though we may be the smallest school on campus, there is no reason why we should not be equally represented, and I know I can be the liaison between the UA and School of Nursing needed to make your voices heard.<br><br>The Penn Nursing name might speak for itself, but don’t let anyone speak for you. I hope I can count on your support.",
