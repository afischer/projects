My joint-platform is based on 5 Pillars: Transparency, Equity & Representation, Sustainability, Wellness & Student Life, and Modern Infrastructure. Just within the past year, my record of both experience and impact proves how I will continue to follow through on projects that directly benefit students.<br><br>For example, beginning in January of this year, I personally directed the renovation of the basement of Van Pelt that will take place this summer in coordination with Penn Facilities and other UA members. Additionally, I’ve worked directly with CAPS, the Provost’s Office, and Penn’s Chief Wellness Officer to develop plans for a pilot program for a CAPS satellite office within Van Pelt Library that’s accessible to all students, regardless of school. Moreover, I have enjoyed promoting student focus groups with high-level administrators like those regarding the new Sophomore Experience or the replacement of Frontera to ensure that the student opinion is always represented.

Additionally, I have served as a member of the UA’s Budget Committee as well as its Speaker Pro Tempore, wherein I have contributed to a fair budgeting process for student government and served as the deputy to the UA’s internal chair, respectively.

As the chair of the United Minorities Council, I led the effort in increasing funding for all cultural groups by securing a $6000 annual allocation for 6B as well as the push for the expansion of minority spaces on campus beyond the basement of Arch. I am also pursuing the creation of a University-wide policy mandating professors to give students make-up midterms in case of legitimate absences due to illness, family emergency, religious reasons, or other unexpected events. The embedded CAPS model I championed for freshmen year is also currently expanding across campus, piloted by Wharton but spreading to other schools as well. All of my initiatives focus on hearing all voices on campus, understanding diverse student needs, and creating tangible changes in response. It is the responsibility of the UA to ensure all students are having the best Penn experiences possible, and to that I say “Yes We Kev”.",

The UA is seen as an organization that is more concerned about airport shuttle sales than the advocacy of the student body. I want to ensure that the student body knows that is false with periodical publications of the UA's projects roughly 4 times a school year and by widely disseminating a UA feedback form, so students know that the UA actually works for them. Moreover, I would like to advocate for all students to have equal access at Penn, which is not the case. Wharton students have more University privileges that College students and that is not equitable. I plan to advocate for equality across schools.",

My chief focus has been to integrate wellness into university life (mainly through the expansion of the Embedded CAPS Model that has been implemented in Wharton) because at Penn, we tend to see ourselves as students first and people second. To combat this culture, I believe that wellness must be tailored to us and made equally accessible. The UA has also afforded me the opportunity to advocate for members of underrepresented groups on campus. I’ve worked alongside the Cultural Resource Centers to plan programming that celebrates student diversity and engineered solutions to challenges faced by the FGLI community. Most importantly, I’ve worked to realize that my voice, as that of a minority and FGLI student, demands to be heard. A vote for Mary is a vote that carries the weight of making all-inclusive change.
