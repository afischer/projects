    Based on its history of expanding into West Philadelphia, Penn now takes a different 

approach to development.  After learning from the consequences of pushing westward 

into existing communities, Penn now prioritizes collaboration and eastward expansion to 

make University City a central hub within Philadelphia. 


  </p>
  <p>
    Without Penn&#146s physical expansion from about 1948 through the 1960&#146s, University City, 
the thriving institutional neighborhood surrounding campus, would not exist today.  

While Penn&#146s development played a key role in creating the vibrancy and innovation on 

and around campus, the means to achieve this end &#150 displacing residents and building 

over communities   has irreversibly stained the University&#146s history with West 

Philadelphia.  But by establishing community partnerships and moving physical 

development from west to east, Penn is now growing in a way that helps amend historical 

tensions while also contributing to the boom of University City.
  </p>

   <h3> Support for the Vision </h3>
  <p>
    In the first half of the 20th century, College Hall and the Benjamin Franklin Statue were surrounded by a congested mix of noisy cars, trolley lines, and pedestrians walking on unattractive concrete sidewalks.

    In 1948, Penn created its first Campus Master Development plan to establish a vision for a pedestrian-oriented, connected campus. Insert quote from Development Plan to give explicit vision
    </p>
  </p>
  <p> 
    &#147We were looking to opportunities to expand across Walnut and Chestnut to create a sense of community further out from central campus,&#148 Datz said.
    proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over the next two decades, Penn&#146s vision moved swiftly into becoming a reality as its development plans benefitted from national policies and citywide support for urban renewal &#150 a movement to revitalize and restructure cities across the country after World War II.

  </div>
  <p>
   Coupled with the post-war research pressure to compete with other universities, federally funded urban renewal projects and Philadelphia&#146s reformist leadership created an ideal environment for Penn to delve into an era of rapid expansion.  Between 1953 and 1970, Penn built 93 new buildings, including the high-rise dorms and Van Pelt Library.
  </p>  
  <p>
    While policies such as the Federal Housing Act of 1959 provided funds for universities to develop, the City of Philadelphia created agencies such as the Redevelopment Authority to help Penn carry out its development plans.

    Insert quote about importance of universities in driving urban growth in the 1950s and 60s

The City&#146s support for Penn&#146s vision can be seen as early as 1950 when Philadelphians voted overwhelmingly in support of having the West Philadelphia trolley lines run underground, rather than disruptively through Penn&#146s campus.  Without the passage of the referendum, the trolley lines would have prevented Penn from building the pedestrian-oriented campus it envisioned. 

  </p>
  </p>
  <p> &#147The referendum indicated that the city was behind the idea that the needs of the people should give way to the University&#146s needs,&#148 Lloyd said.
  </p>
  <p> In 1962, the Philadelphia City Planning Commission (PCPC) designated a University Redevelopment Area of 80 blocks bound by Market and Spruce Streets, and 42nd Street and Schuylkill Avenue.

  <p> Throughout the 1960&#146s, the buildings on what is today Locust Walk were demolished to make way for Penn&#146s vision of a pedestrian, insulated central section of campus.  Several businesses and about 650 homes were displaced, Datz said.
  </p>

  <p> 90% of the people displaced during the development projects &#150 including Hill Square, administrative offices, classrooms and the Inn at Penn &#150 were white, and most of the displaced residents left quietly with the compensation provided by Penn and the City.  
  </p>
  
  <p> While some Walnut Street property owners threatened to legally challenge their displacement, Penn and the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority negotiated deals with the owners to quiet criticism.  Penn promised the Pagano family, who owned many of the prior Walnut Street businesses, the right to redevelop the commercial corners at 38th and Chestnut.

  <h3> A Move into Tension </h3>
  <p> 
    After a relatively successful period of expansion, Penn continued to take part in outward development in the area north of Market Street &#150 a mostly African American neighborhood termed the &#147Black Bottom.&#148
  </p>
<p>  &#147Things in Penn&#146s development had gone pretty well from 1950 through about 1966, so Penn wasn&#146t apprehensive when continuing to expand north of Market Street,&#148 Lloyd said.  &#147But African Americans in that area protested since they did not see the interests of the University as greater than their own.  The mood of the city changed.&#148</p>
<p>
Because this area was outside of Penn&#146s legally designated area for redevelopment, the West Philadelphia Corporation &#150 a coalition of higher education and medical institutions organized by Penn in 1959 &#150 spearheaded the plans for new projects, such as the University City Science Center.
</p>
<p>Quote about how redeveloping this area was in Penn&#146s interest</p>
<p>
According to Census Data, the population in this area fell from 4,603 people in 1960 to 654 in 1970.</p>
<p>
The Black Bottom Association, a community group of African American residents and business owners, led several protests against the urban renewal projects.  Though the WPC was technically leading the redevelopment, the protests were mostly directed toward Penn.</p>

<p>Insert quote about protests from African American members</p>
<p>
In 1969, Penn students filled College Hall in protest against the University&#146s expansion and displacement of African American residents.  Current Netter Center director and undergraduate at the time, Dr. Ira Harkavy led the school in calling out Penn&#146s role in the destruction of West Philadelphia communities.</p>

<p>Insert quote from Dr. Harkavy</p>

<p>Rather than calling the cops to evict the protesting students, President Harnwell opened up discussions with the students.  The protesters reached an agreement with the Trustees to stop expanding and maintain low-cost housing in the neighborhood.</p>
  <h3>Ignorance Is Not Always Bliss  </h3>

<p>After 1970, Penn stopped expanding beyond campus lines.  While the protests definitely deterred further expansion, Penn stopped developing largely because the economy had slowed and the projects could not move forward without more federal funding.  Some plots that had already been cleared sat vacant for over a decade due to a lack of funding.</p>

<p>&#147Expansion had been overdone in the 60&#146s and Penn as a developer essentially ran out of money in the 70&#146s after completing the Superblock and high rises,&#148 Lloyd said.</p>

<p>After stopping westward expansion, Penn insulated itself as a &#147neighborhood within a neighborhood&#148 through the 70s and most of the 80s.</p>

<p>Penn&#146s halted expansion translated into a period of isolation from the community.  Though protests against development ceased, Penn&#146s retraction from the community did not solve clashes with the community.</p>

<p>Crime became a despairing problem for Penn administration.  
 No longer seen as a champion of urban renewal efforts, Penn&#146s expansion had become a target of criticism from those who shamed the one-sided benefits of the University&#146s development.</p> 

 <h3>Establishing a Norm of Collaboration </h3>

<p>In 1992, the University established the Center for Community Partnerships, known today as the Netter Center.  The establishment of this center marks the University&#146s transition into working not as an isolated or entitled institution in the neighborhood, but instead as a conscious collaborator in the community. </p>

<p>Insert quote from Dr. Harkavy about establishment of Netter</p>

<p>&#147Dr. Harkavy helped Penn get in touch with the soul of the University,&#148 Sorrentino said.</p>

<p>When developing, Penn now focuses not only on avoiding displacement and including community input, but also on genuinely revitalizing the land on which it is building.  Both the Penn Park and South Bank projects represent Penn&#146s new approach to development.</p>  

<p>Penn has undergone an evolution in the way it approaches growth.</p>

<p>&#147From taking and clearing land in the 1950s to the community initiatives of the 1990s, we now always try to build in conjunction with the community to support the community,&#148 Datz said.</p>

<p>&#147The way you grow matters,&#148 Caronoli said.</p>

<p>Though development with the community has avoided worsening tensions, an approach of collaboration comes with its own setbacks.  The ongoing conflict over the 40th and Pine mansion &#150 a Penn-owned historic property that is taking over a decade to develop &#150 shows how community input can significantly slow the University&#146s plans.</p> 

<center><div class="image-slider" margin-left="-100px">
<div><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/4273/photoshop-face-before.jpg" /></div>
<img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/s.cdpn.io/4273/photoshop-face-after.jpg" />
</div></center>

<p>Woodland Terrace Homeowners, a group of community members that live near the property, is heading two legal battles against the University&#146s plans to develop the historic mansion into a residential complex.</p> 

<p>Quote from Paul Boni / community member about why they oppose Penn&#146s plan</p>

<p>Though Penn may never achieve a perfect relationship with the community, Penn now consciously includes the community in its decision-making process, even when the resulting opposition makes development more difficult.</p>

<h3>University City Today</h3>

<p>University City is now seen as one of the most thriving, upcoming areas in the country.  UCD&#146s most recent data makes the neighborhood&#146s progress clear:  Over the past five years, over $4.6 billion has been invested into real estate development, with over 2,000 new housing units anticipated by the end of 2016.  As the office occupancy rate rose to 96% this year, University City is expected to have over 80,000 jobs by 2016.  The number of restaurants &#150 up by 17% since 2009 &#150 has also increased with the residential and office growth. </p>

<p>The buildings and institutions that Penn helped create has spurred an influx of i
&#147It is impossible to imagine what University City is today without the role that Penn has had,&#148</p>

<p>Now that University City has become so attractive, the boundaries of what is considered downtown Philadelphia &#150 Center City &#150 may be extending westward to include the neighborhood that Penn has helped create. </p>

<p>With the new Penn-leased FMC and EVO towers, the changing skyline of the city visually shows the increasing inclusion of University City in the flashiness and height of central Philadelphia.</p>

<p id="end">For the first time in fifty years, the Census data shows that the University City area population is increasing for the first time in fifty years.</p>
